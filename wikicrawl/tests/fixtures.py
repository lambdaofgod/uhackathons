AGES_PAGE_TRUNCATED = '{{Version|pre-release}}{{Agenav}}\n\'\'\'Ages\'\'\' represent distinct periods of history. Most ages in [[Europa Universalis V]] last 100 years. Each age has three [[#Institutions|institutions]], which each represent specific cultural or technological paradigm shifts. Each institution has an associated tree of [[#advances|advances]] which represent smaller innovations or specific technologies such as ship designs or production methods.\n\n== List of ages ==\nEvery century is its own age. Each age has its own rules, mechanics, and advance trees that can be progressed through.\n\nAt the start of an age, each country will select one of three focuses, [[#Administrative Ability|Administrative Ability]], [[#Diplomatic Ability|Diplomatic Ability]], or [[#Military Ability|Military Ability]], which determines the options in the advance tree for that age.\n{| class="mildtable plainlist"\n!

When a new age is reached, each institution starts with a 1% chance to spawn each month, growing over time so it spawns soon after the age starts. The location where an institution spawns depends on the game rules. Hovering over an institution that can spawn but has not appeared yet shows all valid spawn locations and the chance for each location to be selected. The location where an institution spawns gains a permanent modifier related to that institution.\n\nOnce an institution has spread at least {{Read define|NCountry|INSTITUTION_MINIMUM_PERCENT|percent=yes}} in a country, it can be embraced at a scaled cost of {{iconify|Stability|resource}} and {{iconify|Gold|resource}}. Embracing an institution will unlock a new branch in the advances tree and begin to spread the institution from the country\'s capital. Embracing an institution also doubles its spread throughout the country but this bonus decreases with lack of control.\n\nInstitutions spread to locations at the following rates:\n* <math>0.02\\cdot\\text{Literacy}</math> if the location\'s market\'s center has the institution\n* <math>0.05\\cdot\\text{Literacy}</math> if the location is the country capital and the country embraced the institution\n* <math>0.005\\cdot\\text{Literacy}</math> if the location shares a sea zone with a location where the institution is present\n* <math>0.01\\cdot\\text{Literacy}</math> if the location is adjacent to a location that has the institution and both locations are in the same country or from countries that have positive opinion of each other\n* <math>2\\cdot\\text{Control}</math> if the location\'s country embraced the institution\n* <math>(0.05\\cdot\\text{Literacy})+(0.02\\cdot\\text{Development})</math> if the location is importing from a place that has the institution\n* <math>0.1\\cdot\\text{Literacy}</math> if the location met the institution spawning requirements and the Institution Spawn game rule is set to Dynamic\n\n=== Age of Traditions ===\nInstitutions from the Age of Traditions start spawned and already spread from their historical location regardless of game rules.'
